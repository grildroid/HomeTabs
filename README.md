# HomeTabs
  HomeTabs project helps you to organize bookmarks for web browsers (like a browser's home page, but cooler).  
  Design of HomeTabs was inspiried by Mozilla Firefox startpage, i think this is the best way to organise bookmarks, but history of browsing saved on homepage - is bad idea.  
  
  **In plans: improve HomeTabs in the future and add a lot of new interesting functions.**
