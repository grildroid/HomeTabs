# HomeTabs
  HomeTabs project helps you to organize bookmarks for web browsers (like a standart browser's home page, but cooler and more comfortable). Design of HomeTabs was inspiried by Mozilla Firefox startpage, i think this is the best way to organise bookmarks, but history of browsing saved on homepage - is bad idea.  
  
  HomeTabs don't collect and don't transfer any of your personal data!  
  
  *In plans: improve HomeTabs in the future and add a lot of new interesting functions.*
